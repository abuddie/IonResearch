#### Fakedata_final-exponentialtime-short

This file is designed to create fake exponential data to test processes in Steps 1 and 2 for analysis of quantum jumps in a trapped ion experiemtal setup. Note: the time minimum, maximum, and interval steps are not in units of seconds; they correspond to values taken from the imaging camera. This will be updated in a Version 2 when new data is taken.
